## Features

Checkout the [quickstart](https://github.com/config-r/config-r/wiki/Quickstart) to get an idea of the basics.

ConfigR does plenty more! Features include the ability to specify the path of your configuration file(s), multiple cascading configuration files and custom configurators. Checkout the [samples](https://github.com/config-r/config-r-samples) for more info.

TIP: you can write **any C# you like** in your 'configuration file' :wink:. The Roslyn [#load](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/wiki/Interactive-Window#load) and [#r](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/wiki/Interactive-Window#r) features are both supported for loading scripts and referencing assemblies.

## Updates

Releases will be pushed regularly to [NuGet](https://nuget.org/packages/ConfigR/).

To build manually, clone or fork this repository and see ['How to build'](#how-to-build).

## Can I help to improve it and/or fix bugs? ##

Absolutely! Please feel free to raise issues, fork the source code, send pull requests, etc.

No pull request is too small. Even whitespace fixes are appreciated. Before you contribute anything make sure you read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/config-r/config-r/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## How to build

Navigate to your clone root folder and execute `build.cmd`. The prerequisite you need is MSBuild 15, which is also included in Visual Studio 2017.

`build.cmd` executes the default build targets which include compilation, test execution and packaging. After the build has completed, the build artifacts will be located in `artifacts/output/`.

You can also build the solution using Visual Studio 2017 or later. At the time of writing the build is only confirmed to work on Windows using the Microsoft .NET framework 4.6+.
